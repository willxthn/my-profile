        <h2>About Me 🥷</h2>
        <p>I am William, I am 18 years old and I am a first year Global BBA student at ESSEC Business School. Next year I have the opportunity to go to the Asia Pacific campus of ESSEC located in Singapore. But I have also been accepted at UC Berkeley for my 3rd year exchange. </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>🏎 Cars / Formula 1 / Competition Karting <br><br> Passionate about cars from a very young age, I share this passion with my father. I have a very important knowledge on the automotive sphere and I cultivate this one by going out in the car that we do with my father during the year. Concerning the competition karting I started last year at the RKC Karting.</p>
        <br>
        <p>🏋️ Gym <br><br> I started going to the gym at the beginning of the year and I now go between 5 and 6 times a week. It is for me the opportunity to spend and take time for me. Bodybuilding is a discipline where one of the most present values is rigor. </p>
         <br>
        <p>💻 Technology <br><br> I've been interested in new technologies since I was a kid and it's a sector that interests me a lot because my father has always worked in the IT sector, so I've always had a very important exposure to this world. In the future I plan to leave a startup in the IT sector. </p>
